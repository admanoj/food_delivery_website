Mitho Sewa is a modern, user-friendly food delivery platform built with Next.js, designed to connect hungry customers with their favorite local restaurants and deliver delicious meals from our cloud kitchen directly to their doorstep.

## 🚀 How It All Started

The idea for Mitho sewa was born out of a personal frustration with existing food delivery apps.
